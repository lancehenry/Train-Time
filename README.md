# Train-Time

## Description
I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates the information from Firebase with moment.js. It provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## How it was built
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Firebase, moment.js
